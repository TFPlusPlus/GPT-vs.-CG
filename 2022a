Consider a viewport of 800x800 pixels, with a coordinate system that ranges from 0-800 in the x and y axes, where (0, 0) is the bottom left corner of the viewport, and (800, 800) is the top right corner of the viewport.

In this viewport are drawn three triangles, where triangle T1 is drawn in red, triangle T2 is drawn in green, and triangle T3 is drawn in blue. The triangles are also being redrawn in wireframe, such that border pixels are drawn in black. The clear-colour for the viewport is white.

The triangles are being drawn in the order T1, T2, T3, with projection and depth testing set up such that if two triangles occupy the same pixel, the pixel will always be the colour of the more recently drawn triangle.

If the projected vertex locations of the triangles in the viewport are as follows:

T1: {(0, 0, 0), (0, 800, 0), (800, 800, 0)}

T2: {(260, 800, 0), (540, 800, 0), (380, 390, 0)}
