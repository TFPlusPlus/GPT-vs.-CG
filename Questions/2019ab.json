You should assume that this image only contains pixels values between 0 and value 255. The width of the input image that is used for testing in this question is 256 pixels.\nNote:\nDo NOT explicitly load any images in your code. Assume that a valid image has already been loaded.\nAssume that the image size needs to be determined by your code.\nYou are required to achieve the task by looping through image pixels, and NOT by calling a built in function.\nThe complete script needs to be pasted (or typed) in the solution area.\nYour script should NOT contain any output commands such as print, Plot or Dialog.\nDo NOT call close or save and the use of the newImage function is forbidden.",
