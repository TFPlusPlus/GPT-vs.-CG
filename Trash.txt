With the recent breakthrough in AI (Artificial Intelligence), particularly LLMs (Large Language Models), tools utilizing such technologies have been made widely available to the public. The most notable example of such tools is ChatGPT, amassing one million users within the first five days of its release, and it has been proven to be helpful in an endless variety of tasks, saving countless hours of work for users worldwide \cite{chatgpt}. Many other specialized tools based on LLMs have also been published or commercialized for public use, such as Midjourney for image processing, GitHub Copilot for programming, and Google Assistant for assisting with everyday tasks.

In the education sector, tools utilizing LLMs focused on teaching and learning have also been developed. Most notably Khan Academy's Khanmigo, which is a GPT-powered teaching assistant (chatbot) capable of providing personal feedback for students, and guiding the students to the correct answer instead of giving the answer directly. With the rapid popularization of Khanmigo and various education tools based on LLMs, more aspects of human-based teaching will be replaced by computers, and feedback for students can also become more readily available, even without the presence of a teacher.

The term ``Artificial Intelligence" dates back as far as 1961 \cite{steps}, and extensive research has been conducted throughout the years, thus it is a discipline that has been studied comprehensively for a long time. Nilsson's 1982 book ``Principles of Artificial Intelligence" recorded the foundation and fundamental theories that are crucial to the field even today \cite{principles}. Over the decades, AI has been used in many areas, such as medicine \cite{aimed}, education \cite{aiedu}, and business \cite{aibus}. More recently, many AI models specialized in understanding human languages, i.e. LLMs, were developed, such as Google's BERT model in 2018 \cite{bert}, Google's T5 model in 2020 \cite{t5}, and OpenAI's GPT-3 model in 2020 \cite{gpt3}. These models achieved impressive performances in various language-related tasks, and this showed exceptional potential in AI-based applications. The popularity of AI skyrocketed with the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in 2022, reaching one million users within the first five days of its release \cite{chatgpt}, and it currently has more than 100 million users \cite{chatgpt100mil}.
