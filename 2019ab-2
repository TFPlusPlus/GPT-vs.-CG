Write a function projectionLength(), that takes as parameters two Vec3d structs a & b, and returns the length of the projection of a on to b.
Your function should have the following signature:
double projectionLength(Vec3d a, Vec3d b)
You can assume that you have access to a struct Vec3d that represents a 3D vector and exposes fields named x, y, and z, and that the following functions are available to you:
double magnitude(Vec3d v)
double dot(Vec3d u, Vec3d v)
Vec3d cross(Vec3d u, Vec3d v)
Vec3d normalized(Vec3d v)
Please note that you may not need to use all of the available functions.
For example:
Test
Vec3d a = {1.0, 2.0, 0.0};
Vec3d b = {1.0, 5.0, 3.0};
double d = projectionLength(a, b);
printf("magnitude = %.2lf", d);
Result
magnitude = 1.86

Task: Write the imagej macro code to find the cumulative histogram of the image
Be aware that there is a run time limit, so make sure that you write your code relatively efficiently!
For marking purposes of this question in Coderunner, overwrite only the FIRST row of pixels of the input image with your histogram count.
Image Input: Assume that the input image is an 8-bit gray scale image. You should assume that this image only contains pixels values between 0 and value 255. The width of the input image that is used for testing in this question is 256 pixels.
Note:
Do NOT explicitly load any images in your code. Assume that a valid image has already been loaded.
Assume that the image size needs to be determined by your code.
You are required to achieve the task by looping through image pixels, and NOT by calling a built in function.
The complete script needs to be pasted (or typed) in the solution area.
Your script should NOT contain any output commands such as print, Plot or Dialog.
Do NOT call close or save and the use of the newImage function is forbidden.
