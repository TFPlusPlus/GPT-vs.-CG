Generated answers contradict each other, e.g. (a) was stated to be the correct answer at the start, then (b) was stated to be correct at the end.

Not a lot of variety was shown in some generated answers, even wrong ones. (Temperature = 0.75)

The language is not specified, so some Python/Java solutions are produced instead of C++.

Some OpenGL specifics could not be generated consistently (only sometimes), such as glBegin() and glEnd().

Minor errors are found consistently which stop programs from working (only slight tweaks are needed, e.g. function calls: pq.cross(pr) instead of cross(pq, pr) [2022a13])

2022a15: Small details such as vertex order (anticlockwise) could not be captured.

2022a17: Small details such as operand order ("Vector3 * int" instead of "int * Vector") could not be captured. Concepts are "well understood", but implementations are lacking slightly in terms of specific requirements.
